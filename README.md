# Fanart-Bot
Simple bot that scrapes google images search for a specific query caches the results and then sends a randomly selected image hourly 

You will have to add your own API tokens in apitokens.py

additionally the query is by default set to Jamil Twisted Wonderland as that was the initial purpose for the bot you may also change this under search parameters under images.py

I don't know how to write readme's to bear with me and for any further questions please feel free to add comments
