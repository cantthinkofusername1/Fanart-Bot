# Fanart-Bot
Simple bot that scrapes google images search for a specific query caches the results and then sends a randomly selected image hourly 

When the bot is finished and if I decide to make this publicly available you will probably have to add your own search engine in the images.py file under gis

additionally the query is by default set to Jamil Twisted Wonderland as that was the initial purpose for the bot you may also change this under search parameters under images.py

I don't know how to write readme's to bear with me and for any further questions please feel free to add comments
